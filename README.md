# MuscleHub A/B Testing Analysis Project
    - I used Python, Pandas and SQL to conduct an A/B test on the database of the visitors of the Cameroon based MuscleHub gym . 
    - I conducted A/B and Hypothesis tests to determine if visitors that were not asked to take a fitness test prior to membership purchase were more likely to purchase a membership than visitors who were asked to take the fitness test as a prerequisite and I discovered that the former was true. 
    - I visualized my findings on bar and pie charts using MatPlotlib.
